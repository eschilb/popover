# Popover

## Overview

Popover is a pop-up dinner scheduling application. Users can host events at their home or around Austin, TX and members can RSVP to attend events.

## Goal

Popover connects and brings together everyone that falls under the umbrella of "foodie." In Austin, many people fit the bill as the target market but have yet to meet in a casual and unintimidating environment. Popover allows members to set up pop-up dinner events that they host and have full control over the menu and anything optional that they would like (themes, entertainment, talks/discussions). Members can then RSVP to the pop-up dinner event that they are interested in attending. We know it can be intimidating to walk in without knowing any other attendees so members can optionally bring a guest.

After each event, the attendees can leave ratings for the host and reviews for the event.

## Process

### Design research 

What inspired the idea of Popover are the bounty of secret dinners, supper clubs, and underground restaurants that Austin already has. Edible Austin has an [article][EdibleArticle] on popular supper clubs but the common theme is that the plates are generally a higher price tag than what the majority are willing to pay. The concept is amazing but I believe that there is a market that is a part of the food scene and interested in a pop-up dinner at a lower price tag.

The purpose of the design research process was to inform the design decisions made for the layout and styling for the app. User surveys were circulated among social media channels and fellow students to gather feedback about their interests regarding dinner parties. Once the answers were collected and reviewed, recurring themes emerged and I noted the features that should be included or be most prominently displayed in the layout of the app.

I also made word lists, user personas, and a user flow.
