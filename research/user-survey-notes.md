# Notes about User Surveys

## I conducted surveys to gather information about what matters to users when attending dinner parties. Here are some common themes that have come from the answers:

The most common response when asked what interests them most when attending a dinner party was to meet new people and the dining experience. The less common response was the entertainment and discussion/topics that are interesting to them.

When asked if they would be willing to make a donation to the host of a dinner party, all users responded that they would be willing to pay and most users were willing to pay and it could either cover the cost of the party or go to a charity.

When asked if they would be willing to go to a dinner party where they didn't know anyone, some users were willing to go but most surveyed would prefer to know at least one other person at the dinner party.

When asked if they generally try new things on a menu or get the same thing when they go to a restaurant, most surveyed try new things on the menu but a large percentage also get the same thing.

When asked if using localy sourced ingredients matters to them, those surveyed were pretty evenly split between it mattering to them or not.

## Implications of the survey results:

Each question has yielded interesting responses about what features are important and how features should be integrated into the web application.

Since most users would attend a dinner party to meet new people and for the dining experience and the entertainment and topics/discussions that interest them are secondary reasons that would interest them at a dinner party, the application can serve a largest user base if it primarily features the dinner events as a meetup and dining experience and secondarily an event featuring entertainment/discussions/topics. Each event can have a cost associated with attendance or a membership fee associated with using the app. The app should also encourage bringing a friend. The menu should be featured more prominently in each event description to cater to users that want to prepare beforehand and know that they will enjoy the fare served. Alternatively, to cater to the users that like to try new things, there can be an option to create an event with a surprise menu or just giving a less detailed description of what fare will be served so that users have an idea if they will like it or be interested in the food and still have curiousity and surprise surrounding the event. The app shouldn't feature events focused on only locally sourced ingredients, but it can alternatively mention within an event description whether the menu features any locally sourced ingredients.
